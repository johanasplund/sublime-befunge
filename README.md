Befunge-93 for Sublime Text
===============

This package provides syntax highlighting and an interpreter of the esoteric programming language Befunge-93 for Sublime Text 2 and 3 written in Python. The syntax highlighting is loosely based on [Pygments](http://pygments.org/).

A standalone visual interpreter written in Python and pygame is found at https://github.com/johanasplund/befunge-93.

Befunge-93 is a two-dimensional esoteric programming language in the Funge-family made by Chris Pressey in 1993, which was made as an attempt of creating a language which was as hard as possible to compile. Befunge-93 consists of a two-dimensional *playfield* and a *program-counter*. The program-counter begins at a set location (upper-left corner of the playfield) and initially travels to the right. As the program-counter travels it encounters instructions, which gets executed.

## Todo
- ~~Implement an [interpreter](https://github.com/johanasplund/befunge-93)~~
- Make the output cleaner and without numerous unicode-characters
